# Inform Class Projects

This summer I took a class on text adventures and gaming history. Along the way I made a few text adventures myself, which you can find in this repository. The "challenge-x.inform"
projects do not have any real story – they were games we were tasked to make to demonstrate that we could implement a specific feature correctly.

One Angry Wizard is a puzzle game where you are trapped in a pocket dimension created by... an angry wizard, and have to find a way out. You can download a `.gblorb` of the game
[here][gblorb] to play on your machine with an IF interpreter (I use [Gargoyle](https://github.com/garglk/garglk)).

## Installation

To install the games, clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FIGBERT/inform-class.git
```
And install [the editor](http://inform7.com/downloads/):

```bash
# macOS
brew cask install inform
```

## Playing 

Open the `.inform` directory in the Inform7 editor. To play the game without exiting the editor, hit the "Go!" button in the top-left. To export the game to a playable `.gblorb`,
hit the "Release" button and navigate to the directory displayed on-screen.

If you downloaded the `.gblorb` directly, just load it into your interactive fiction player and have fun!
