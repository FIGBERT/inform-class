One Angry Wizard, or the Tentacular Adventures of our Brave Hero through a World Most Strange and Foreign
A puzzle game about an angry wizard by FIGBERT
Release 1 / Serial number 200722 / Inform 7 build 6M62 (I6/v6.34 lib 6/12N) SD

Great Room
Your eyes blink open, and you find yourself in the most grand room you've ever seen. The entire room is crafted from giant blocks of a sand-colored stone, stacked up to a ceiling high above where a massive mural is painted onto the rock.

I've trapped you in a pocket dimension (literally in my pocket, enjoy the crumbs) because I hate you. I hate you so much. You didn't buy me a present for my birthday, and now you'll pay the price.

To the south, a small blue door is embedded in the rock.

Behind you to the west you see a hallway, hewn out of the stone, leading to another room.

Before you to the east, taking up almost the entire wall, is a great metal door painted a deep blue and patterned with yellow and white veins that run throughout. At the base of the door are four keyholes and four doorknobs.

Cluttered Room
You pass through the stone hallway, and step out in to the most cluttered room you've ever seen. You spin around, and bump into a tall stack of chairs. A snicker echoes from above, and you're reminded about how stupid this situation is.

You find yourself in a room, half the size of the previous room, filled to the brim with chairs, folded tables, closed crates, and smaller tidbits: rolled-up newspapers, stacks of loose paper, broken electronics, a Peloton, watches in a display case, a lamp, pots and pans, and other bits such items scattered about. To the south, almost obscured behind two stacked couches, you see door.

To your left you see a dented bucket overflowing with junk. Or maybe it's important items for progressing in the game.

Cobble Wall
You push through the door, and find yourself in a tiny room. To your left a cobblestone wall stretches up high above, ending just before the ceiling. Rocks here and there seem to have fallen out of the wall over the ages it has stood in place, creating holes of varying sizes throughout the surface.

To the north you can see the door you came through earlier.

In the center of the wall to the east, you can see a hole as average as yourself. It's so normal it's disappointing.

To the southeast, you can see a miniscule hole, barely larger than your average United State dime, a ten-cent coin, one tenth of a United States dollar, labeled formally as "one dime". The denomination was first authorized by the Coinage Act of 1792. The dime is the smallest in diameter and is the thinnest of all U.S. coins currently minted for circulation, being 0.705 inches (17.91 millimeters) in diameter and 0.053 in (1.35 mm) in thickness. The hole is that size.

Cobble Wall
A tiny room. To your left a cobblestone wall stretches up high above, ending just before the ceiling. Rocks here and there seem to have fallen out of the wall over the ages it has stood in place, creating holes of varying sizes throughout the surface.

To the southeast, you can see a miniscule hole, barely larger than your average United State dime, a ten-cent coin, one tenth of a United States dollar, labeled formally as "one dime". The denomination was first authorized by the Coinage Act of 1792. The dime is the smallest in diameter and is the thinnest of all U.S. coins currently minted for circulation, being 0.705 inches (17.91 millimeters) in diameter and 0.053 in (1.35 mm) in thickness. The hole is that size.

To the north you can see the door you came through earlier.

In the center of the wall to the east, you can see a hole as average as yourself. It's so normal it's disappointing.

To the northeast, you see a hole roughly the size of a fist, punched through the rock in a feat of strength, possibly in frustration, possibly with this game.

Library
You arrive in a long room full of thousands and thousands of bookshelves, filled to the brim with dust-covered tomes. An ancient library, with books on topics much too complex for you to understand. The shelves continue further south.

Behind you to the west, you see a rocky door in the wall.

To the east you see a thick metal door, its industrial design a strange contrast to the otherwise ancient architecture you've encountered in this world so far.

Extruded from the door is a safe labeled "KEY", held closed by a 5-digit combination lock. There's a decimal point between the third and fourth digit of the number, which is odd for a combination lock.

Aquarium
You push through the door, and find yourself in a drastically different room with plain concrete walls and a black floor flecked with gray spots. The ceiling looks basically the same as the walls from where you're standing, but between you and me, it's a "living roof" - a roof with a grass on top.

To the north, a door that almost looks like a miniature of the grand door from the Great Room - metal blue panels with white-and-yellow veins, square but capped by a glass half-circle on the top - is embedded in the rock.

To the west you see a thick metal door.

In the center of the room, taking up the majority of the space in the room is a giant fish tank. The first half meter of the tank is black glass, presumably hiding the inner workings of the tank. Above the base, the glass tank walls extend up for two meters. There does not appear to be a lid, but a sign next to the tank says in red, "NO MOLLUSCS IN THE TANK." Half submerged in the sand at the bottom of the fish tank, a small metal object glints and sparkles in the light.

Great Room
A grand room built from giant blocks of a sand-colored stone, stacked up to a ceiling high above where a massive compass lays embedded in the rock.

To the south, a small blue door is embedded in the rock.

Behind you to the west you see a hallway, hewn out of the stone, leading  to another room.

Before you to the east, taking up almost the entire wall, is a great metal door painted a deep blue and patterned with yellow and white veins that run throughout. At the base of the door are four keyholes and four doorknobs.

Cluttered Room
You pass through the stone hallway, and step out in to the most cluttered room you've ever seen. You spin around, and bump into a tall stack of chairs like a moron.

You find yourself in a room, half the size of the previous room, filled to the brim with chairs, folded tables, closed crates, and smaller tidbits scattered about.

Behind you to the east you see a hallway, hewn out of the stone, leading  to another room.

To the south, almost obscured behind a large gray couch, you see a door.

To your right you see a dented bucket overflowing with junk. Or maybe it's important items for progressing in the game.

The couch, lying to your left in front of the door, sags with (fake) age, and it's got tears in the tattered fabric in some places.

To the north you can see the door you came through earlier.

In the center of the wall to the east, you can see a hole as average as yourself. It's so normal it's disappointing.

To the southeast, you can see a miniscule hole, barely larger than your average United State dime, a ten-cent coin, one tenth of a United States dollar, labeled formally as "one dime". The denomination was first authorized by the Coinage Act of 1792. The dime is the smallest in diameter and is the thinnest of all U.S. coins currently minted for circulation, being 0.705 inches (17.91 millimeters) in diameter and 0.053 in (1.35 mm) in thickness. The hole is that size.

To the northeast, you see a hole roughly the size of a fist, punched through the rock in a feat of strength, possibly in frustration, possibly with this game.

Cluttered Room
You pass through the stone hallway, and step out in to the most cluttered room you've ever seen. You spin around, and bump into a tall stack of chairs like a moron.

You find yourself in a room, half the size of the previous room, filled to the brim with chairs, folded tables, closed crates, and smaller tidbits scattered about.

Behind you to the east you see a hallway, hewn out of the stone, leading  to another room.

To the south, almost obscured behind a large gray couch, you see a door.

To your right you see a dented bucket overflowing with junk. Or maybe it's important items for progressing in the game.

The couch, lying to your left in front of the door, sags with (fake) age, and it's got tears in the tattered fabric in some places.

You land in the next room just beyond the exit of the hallway, and the ground rumbles as it collapses behind you. You find yourself in what seems to be an ancient cobblestone maze. Rocks here and there seem to have fallen out of the wall over the ages it has stood in place, creating fist-sized holes in the walls. The path extends out to the east and west to either side. To the east you see a hallway continuing into the next room.

On the wall is a giant sign that says "PUZZLE INOPERABLE."

To the south, almost obscured behind a large gray couch, you see a closed door.

Great Room
A grand room built from giant blocks of a sand-colored stone, stacked up to a ceiling high above where a massive compass lays embedded in the rock.

Behind you to the west you see a hallway, hewn out of the stone, leading  to another room.

To the south, a small blue door is embedded in the rock.

Before you to the east, taking up almost the entire wall, is a great metal door painted a deep blue and patterned with yellow and white veins that run throughout. At the base of the door are four keyholes and four doorknobs.

Cobble Wall
You push through the door, and find yourself in a tiny room. To your left a cobblestone wall stretches up high above, ending just before the ceiling. Rocks here and there seem to have fallen out of the wall over the ages it has stood in place, creating holes of varying sizes throughout the surface.

To the north you can see the door you came through earlier.

In the center of the wall to the east, you can see a hole as average as yourself. It's so normal it's disappointing.

To the southeast, you can see a miniscule hole, barely larger than your average United State dime, a ten-cent coin, one tenth of a United States dollar, labeled formally as "one dime". The denomination was first authorized by the Coinage Act of 1792. The dime is the smallest in diameter and is the thinnest of all U.S. coins currently minted for circulation, being 0.705 inches (17.91 millimeters) in diameter and 0.053 in (1.35 mm) in thickness. The hole is that size.

To the northeast, you see a hole roughly the size of a fist, punched through the rock in a feat of strength, possibly in frustration, possibly with this game.

Library
You arrive in a long room full of thousands and thousands of bookshelves, filled to the brim with dust-covered tomes. An ancient library, with books on topics much too complex for you to understand. The shelves continue further south.

Behind you to the west, you see a rocky door in the wall.

To the east you see a thick metal door, its industrial design a strange contrast to the otherwise ancient architecture you've encountered in this world so far.

Extruded from the door is a safe labeled "KEY", held closed by a 5-digit combination lock. There's a decimal point between the third and fourth digit of the number, which is odd for a combination lock.

Aquarium
You push through the door, and find yourself in a drastically different room with plain concrete walls and a black floor flecked with gray spots. The ceiling looks basically the same as the walls from where you're standing, but between you and me, it's a "living roof" - a roof with a grass on top.

To the west you see a thick metal door.

In the center of the room, taking up the majority of the space in the room is a giant fish tank. The first half meter of the tank is black glass, presumably hiding the inner workings of the tank. Above the base, the glass tank walls extend up for two meters. There does not appear to be a lid, but a sign next to the tank says in red, "NO MOLLUSCS IN THE TANK." Half submerged in the sand at the bottom of the fish tank, a small metal object glints and sparkles in the light.

Great Room
A grand room built from giant blocks of a sand-colored stone, stacked up to a ceiling high above where a massive compass lays embedded in the rock.

To the south, a small blue door is embedded in the rock.

Behind you to the west you see a hallway, hewn out of the stone, leading  to another room.

Before you to the east, taking up almost the entire wall, is a great metal door painted a deep blue and patterned with yellow and white veins that run throughout. At the base of the door are four keyholes and four doorknobs.

I'll release you for now. If you bring me a present next year I might consider turning you back into a human.

In the center of the wall to the east, you can see a hole as average as yourself. It's so normal it's disappointing.

To the southeast, you can see a miniscule hole, barely larger than your average United State dime, a ten-cent coin, one tenth of a United States dollar, labeled formally as "one dime". The denomination was first authorized by the Coinage Act of 1792. The dime is the smallest in diameter and is the thinnest of all U.S. coins currently minted for circulation, being 0.705 inches (17.91 millimeters) in diameter and 0.053 in (1.35 mm) in thickness. The hole is that size.

To the northeast, you see a hole roughly the size of a fist, punched through the rock in a feat of strength, possibly in frustration, possibly with this game.

Library
You arrive in a long room full of thousands and thousands of bookshelves, filled to the brim with dust-covered tomes. An ancient library, with books on topics much too complex for you to understand. The shelves continue further south.

Behind you to the west, you see a rocky door in the wall.

To the east you see a thick metal door, its industrial design a strange contrast to the otherwise ancient architecture you've encountered in this world so far.

Extruded from the door is a safe labeled "KEY", held closed by a 5-digit combination lock. There's a decimal point between the third and fourth digit of the number, which is odd for a combination lock.

Aquarium
You push through the door, and find yourself in a drastically different room with plain concrete walls and a black floor flecked with gray spots. The ceiling looks basically the same as the walls from where you're standing, but between you and me, it's a "living roof" - a roof with a grass on top.

To the north, a door that almost looks like a miniature of the grand door from the Great Room - metal blue panels with white-and-yellow veins - is embedded in the rock. In the Middle Eastern style, the top of the door is a semicircle.

To the west you see a thick metal door.

In the center of the room, taking up the majority of the space in the room is a giant fish tank. The bottom half meter of the tank is black glass, presumably hiding the inner workings of the tank. Above the base, the glass tank walls extend up for another two meters. There does not appear to be a lid, but a sign next to the tank says in red, "NO MOLLUSCS IN THE TANK." Half submerged in the sand at the bottom of the fish tank, a small metal object glints and sparkles in the light.

Great Room
A grand room built from giant blocks of a sand-colored stone, stacked up to a ceiling high above where a massive compass lays embedded in the rock.

To the south, a small blue door is embedded in the rock.

Behind you to the west you see a hallway, hewn out of the stone, leading  to another room.

Before you to the east, taking up almost the entire wall, is a great metal door painted a deep blue and patterned with yellow and white veins that run throughout. At the base of the door are four keyholes and four doorknobs.

Cobble Wall
You push through the door, and find yourself in a tiny room. To your left a cobblestone wall stretches up high above, ending just before the ceiling. Rocks here and there seem to have fallen out of the wall over the ages it has stood in place, creating holes of varying sizes throughout the surface.

To the north you can see the door you came through earlier.

In the center of the wall to the east, you can see a hole as average as yourself. It's so normal it's disappointing.

To the southeast, you can see a miniscule hole, barely larger than your average United State dime, a ten-cent coin, one tenth of a United States dollar, labeled formally as "one dime". The denomination was first authorized by the Coinage Act of 1792. The dime is the smallest in diameter and is the thinnest of all U.S. coins currently minted for circulation, being 0.705 inches (17.91 millimeters) in diameter and 0.053 in (1.35 mm) in thickness. The hole is that size.

To the northeast, you see a hole roughly the size of a fist, punched through the rock in a feat of strength, possibly in frustration, possibly with this game.

A grand room built from giant blocks of a sand-colored stone, stacked up to a ceiling high above where a massive compass lays embedded in the rock.

To the south, a small blue door is embedded in the rock.

Behind you to the west you see a hallway, hewn out of the stone, leading  to another room.

Before you to the east, taking up almost the entire wall, is a great metal door painted a deep blue and patterned with yellow and white veins that run throughout. At the base of the door are four keyholes and four doorknobs.

Cobble Wall
You push through the door, and find yourself in a tiny room. To your left a cobblestone wall stretches up high above, ending just before the ceiling. Rocks here and there seem to have fallen out of the wall over the ages it has stood in place, creating holes of varying sizes throughout the surface.

To the north you can see the door you came through earlier.

In the center of the wall to the east, you can see a hole as average as yourself. It's so normal it's disappointing.

To the southeast, you can see a miniscule hole, barely larger than your average United State dime, a ten-cent coin, one tenth of a United States dollar, labeled formally as "one dime". The denomination was first authorized by the Coinage Act of 1792. The dime is the smallest in diameter and is the thinnest of all U.S. coins currently minted for circulation, being 0.705 inches (17.91 millimeters) in diameter and 0.053 in (1.35 mm) in thickness. The hole is that size.

To the northeast, you see a hole roughly the size of a fist, punched through the rock in a feat of strength, possibly in frustration, possibly with this game.

Cobble Wall
A thin, wide room that ends abruptly in front you in an ancient cobblestone wall. The wall stretches up high above, ending just before the ceiling. Rocks here and there seem to have fallen out of the wall over the ages it has stood in place, creating holes of varying sizes in the walls (though as I believe I've made clear, it's not actually ancient because it's fake so the holes have been there since I created it).

To the southeast, you can see a miniscule hole, barely larger than your average United State dime, a ten-cent coin, one tenth of a United States dollar, labeled formally as "one dime". The denomination was first authorized by the Coinage Act of 1792. The dime is the smallest in diameter and is the thinnest of all U.S. coins currently minted for circulation, being 0.705 inches (17.91 millimeters) in diameter and 0.053 in (1.35 mm) in thickness. The hole looks like that.

To the north you can see the door you came through earlier.

Directly in front of you - to the east, imbicile - you see a hole as average as yourself. It's so normal it's dissapointing.

In the northeast of the wall, you see a hole roughly the size of a fist, punched through the rock in a feat of strength far out of reach of one such as yourself.

Library
Frustrated, you arrive in a room full of thousands and thousands of books. Just as the thought crosses your mind, you hear that voice again.

"It's not a room full of books, you imbecile. It's a library."

That would make sense. To the east you see a hallway continuing into the next room.

On the wall is a giant sign that says "PUZZLE INOPERABLE."

Directly in front of you - to the east, imbicile - you see a hole as average as yourself. It's so normal it's dissapointing.

Behind you to the west, you see a rocky door in the wall.

To the east you see a thick metal door, its industrial design a strange contrast to the otherwise ancient design you've encountered in this world so far. Extruded from the door is a box labeled "KEY", apparently held closed by a 2-digit combination lock, which is a little odd for state-of-the-art security.

"Socrates' ancient words are still true, and the ideas found in Plato's Dialogues still form the foundation of a thinking person's education. This superb collection contains excellent contemporary translations selected for their clarity and accessibility to today's reader, as well as an incisive introduction by Erich Segal, which reveals Plato's life and clarifies the philosophical issues examined in each dialogue. The first four dialogues recount the trial and execution of Socrates-the extraordinary tragedy that changed Plato's life and forever altered the course of Western thought. Other dialogues create a rich tableau of intellectual life in Athens in the fourth century b.c., and examine such timeless-and timely-issues as the nature of virtue and love, knowledge and truth, society and the individual. Resounding with the humor and astounding brilliance of Socrates, the immortal iconoclast, these great works remain powerful, probing, and essential."

Aquarium
A large room with plain concrete walls and a black floor flecked with gray spots. The ceiling looks basically the same as the walls from where you're standing, but between you and me, it's a "living roof" - a roof with a grass on top.

To the west you see a thick metal door.

In the center of the room, taking up the majority of the space in the room is a giant fishtank. The first half meter of the tank is an black wall, presumably hiding the inner workings of the tank. Above the base, the glass tank walls extend up for two meters, where they end at a mesh lid.

Library
A great library, full to the brim with books. The shelves continue further south.

Behind you to the west, you see a rocky door in the wall.

To the east you see a thick metal door, its industrial design a strange contrast to the otherwise ancient architecture you've encountered in this world so far.

Extruded from the door is a safe labeled "KEY", held closed by a 5-digit combination lock. There's a decimal point between the third and fourth digit of the number, which is odd for a combination lock.

Mirror Maze
You slide the bottom of the tunnel, and immediately are confronted by... octopi. Hundreds of octopi in every direction. You leap to get out of the way and let out a high-pitched shriek.

The octopi ripple as a laugh shakes the room.

You look closer at the octopi and see... mirrors. Boaz turned you into an octopus, and brought you to a mirror maze. Everywhere you look, octopi follow your gaze - eight tentacles sliding over the ground as you move. To the north you see a hallway continuing into the next room.

On the wall is a giant sign that says "PUZZLE INOPERABLE."

To the west you see a thick metal door.

Library
You arrive in a long room full of thousands and thousands of bookshelves, filled to the brim with dust-covered tomes. An ancient library, with books on topics much too complex for you to understand. The shelves continue further south.

To the east you see a thick metal door, its industrial design a strange contrast to the otherwise ancient architecture you've encountered in this world so far.

Cobble Wall
You push through the door, and find yourself in a tiny room that ends abruptly to your left in an ancient cobblestone wall. The wall stretches up high above, ending just before the ceiling. Rocks here and there seem to have fallen out of the wall over the ages it has stood in place, creating holes of varying sizes in the walls (though as I believe I've made clear, it's not actually ancient because it's fake so the holes have been there since I created it).

To the north you can see the door you came through earlier.

In the center of the wall to the east, you can see a hole as average as yourself. It's so normal it's dissapointing.

To the southeast, you can see a miniscule hole, barely larger than your average United State dime, a ten-cent coin, one tenth of a United States dollar, labeled formally as "one dime". The denomination was first authorized by the Coinage Act of 1792. The dime is the smallest in diameter and is the thinnest of all U.S. coins currently minted for circulation, being 0.705 inches (17.91 millimeters) in diameter and 0.053 in (1.35 mm) in thickness. The hole looks like that.

In the northeast of the wall, you see a hole roughly the size of a fist, punched through the rock in a feat of strength far out of reach of one such as yourself.

Cobble Wall
A tiny room that ends abruptly to your left in an ancient cobblestone wall. The wall stretches up high above, ending just before the ceiling. Rocks here and there seem to have fallen out of the wall over the ages it has stood in place, creating holes of varying sizes in the walls (though as I believe I've made clear, it's not actually ancient because it's fake so the holes have been there since I created it).

To the southeast, you can see a miniscule hole, barely larger than your average United State dime, a ten-cent coin, one tenth of a United States dollar, labeled formally as "one dime". The denomination was first authorized by the Coinage Act of 1792. The dime is the smallest in diameter and is the thinnest of all U.S. coins currently minted for circulation, being 0.705 inches (17.91 millimeters) in diameter and 0.053 in (1.35 mm) in thickness. The hole looks like that.

To the north you can see the door you came through earlier.

In the center of the wall to the east, you can see a hole as average as yourself. It's so normal it's dissapointing.

In the northeast of the wall, you see a hole roughly the size of a fist, punched through the rock in a feat of strength far out of reach of one such as yourself.

A small section of the wall eases forward with a sigh, revealing a passageway east.

Library
You arrive in a long room full of thousands and thousands of bookshelves, full to the brim with dust-covered tomes. An ancient library, with books on topics much to complex for you to understand. The shelves continue further south.

Behind you to the west, you see a rocky door in the wall.

To the east you see a thick metal door, its industrial design a strange contrast to the otherwise ancient design you've encountered in this world so far. Extruded from the door is a box labeled "KEY", apparently held closed by a 2-digit combination lock, which is a little odd for state-of-the-art security.

Library (Shelf #1)
This section of the library is much the same as all the rest: shelves of books to either side, untouched books lying on their shelves.

Lying on the shelf to your left, a dustless green tome lies on its side. Gold lettering on its spine reads "The Dialogues of Plato." Lower down, its call number is printed: 184.2.

Standing on the right shelf, a tome with a suspicious amount of dust rests on the right shelf. Silver lettering on its spine reads "The Great Transformation," and below that its call number is written "200.9."

"Socrates' ancient words are still true, and the ideas found in Plato's Dialogues still form the foundation of a thinking person's education. This superb collection contains excellent contemporary translations selected for their clarity and accessibility to today's reader, as well as an incisive introduction by Erich Segal, which reveals Plato's life and clarifies the philosophical issues examined in each dialogue. The first four dialogues recount the trial and execution of Socrates-the extraordinary tragedy that changed Plato's life and forever altered the course of Western thought. Other dialogues create a rich tableau of intellectual life in Athens in the fourth century b.c., and examine such timeless-and timely-issues as the nature of virtue and love, knowledge and truth, society and the individual. Resounding with the humor and astounding brilliance of Socrates, the immortal iconoclast, these great works remain powerful, probing, and essential."

Great Room
A grand room built from giant blocks of a sand-colored stone, stacked up to a ceiling high above where a massive compass lays embedded in the rock.

Behind you to the west you see a hallway, hewn out of the stone, leading  to another room.

To the south, a small blue door is embedded in the rock.

Before you to the east, taking up almost the entire wall, is a great metal door painted a deep blue and patterned with yellow and white veins that run throughout. At the base of the door are four keyholes and four doorknobs.

A room, half the size of the previous room, filled to the brim with chairs, folded tables, closed crates, and smaller tidbits scattered about.

Back to the east you see a hallway, hewn out of the stone, leading to another room.

To the south, almost obscured behind a large gray couch, you see a closed door.

To your left you see a dented bucket overflowing with junk. Or maybe it's important items for progressing in the game.

The couch lying in front of the door sags with (fake) age, and it's got tears in the tattered fabric in some places.

Cobble Wall
You push through the door, and find yourself in a thin, wide room that ends abruptly in front you in an ancient cobblestone wall.

To the south, almost obscured behind a large gray couch, you see a open door.

The wall stretches up high above, ending just before the ceiling. Rocks here and there seem to have fallen out of the wall over the ages it has stood in place, creating fist-sized holes in the walls (though as I believe I've made clear, it's not actually ancient because it's fake so the holes have been there since I created it).

To the north you can see the door you came through earlier.

Directly in front of you - to the east, imbicile - you see a hole as average as yourself. It's so normal it's dissapointing.

To the southeast, you can see a miniscule hole, barely larger than your average United State dime, a ten-cent coin, one tenth of a United States dollar, labeled formally as "one dime". The denomination was first authorized by the Coinage Act of 1792. The dime is the smallest in diameter and is the thinnest of all U.S. coins currently minted for circulation, being 0.705 inches (17.91 millimeters) in diameter and 0.053 in (1.35 mm) in thickness. The hole looks like that.

In the northeast of the wall, you see a hole roughly the size of a fist, punched through the rock in a feat of strength far out of reach of one such as yourself.

        <result xml:space="preserve">Cobble Wall
A thin, wide room that ends abruptly in front you in an ancient cobblestone wall. The wall stretches up high above, ending just before the ceiling. Rocks here and there seem to have fallen out of the wall over the ages it has stood in place, creating holes of varying sizes in the walls (though as I believe I've made clear, it's not actually ancient because it's fake so the holes have been there since I created it).

To the southeast, you can see a miniscule hole, barely larger than your average United State dime, a ten-cent coin, one tenth of a United States dollar, labeled formally as "one dime". The denomination was first authorized by the Coinage Act of 1792. The dime is the smallest in diameter and is the thinnest of all U.S. coins currently minted for circulation, being 0.705 inches (17.91 millimeters) in diameter and 0.053 in (1.35 mm) in thickness. The hole looks like that.

To the north you can see the door you came through earlier.

Directly in front of you - to the east, imbicile - you see a hole as average as yourself. It's so normal it's dissapointing.

In the northeast of the wall, you see a hole roughly the size of a fist, punched through the rock in a feat of strength far out of reach of one such as yourself.

Great Room
A grand room built from giant blocks of a sand-colored stone, stacked up to a ceiling high above where a massive compass lays embedded in the rock.

Behind you to the west you see a hallway, hewn out of the stone, leading  to another room.

Before you to the east, taking up almost the entire wall, is a great metal door painted a deep blue and patterned with yellow and white veins that run throughout. At the base of the door are four keyholes and four doorknobs.

Library
You arrive in a long room full of thousands and thousands of bookshelves, filled to the brim with dust-covered tomes. An ancient library, with books on topics much too complex for you to understand. The shelves continue further south.

Behind you to the west, you see a rocky door in the wall.

To the east you see a thick metal door, its industrial design a strange contrast to the otherwise ancient architecture you've encountered in this world so far.

Extruded from the door is a safe labeled "KEY", held closed by a 5-digit combination lock. There's a decimal point between the third and fourth digit of the number, which is odd for a combination lock.

Aquarium
You push through the door, and find yourself in a drastically different room with plain concrete walls and a black floor flecked with gray spots. The ceiling looks basically the same as the walls from where you're standing, but between you and me, it's a "living roof" - a roof with a grass on top.

To the north, a door that almost looks like a miniature of the grand door from the Great Room - metal blue panels with white-and-yellow veins - is embedded in the rock. In the Middle Eastern style, the top of the door is a semicircle.

To the west you see a thick metal door.

In the center of the room, taking up the majority of the space in the room is a giant fish tank. The bottom half meter of the tank is black glass, presumably hiding the inner workings of the tank. Above the base, the glass tank walls extend up for another two meters. There does not appear to be a lid, but a sign next to the tank says in red, "NO MOLLUSCS IN THE TANK." Half submerged in the sand at the bottom of the fish tank, a small metal object glints and sparkles in the light.

The denomination was first authorized by the Coinage Act of 1792. The dime is the smallest in diameter and is the thinnest of all U.S. coins currently minted for circulation, being 0.705 inches (17.91 millimeters) in diameter and 0.053 in (1.35 mm) in thickness.

Aquarium
You push through the door, and find yourself in a drastically different room with plain concrete walls and a black floor flecked with gray spots. The ceiling looks basically the same as the walls from where you're standing, but between you and me, it's a "living roof" - a roof with a grass on top.

To the north, a door that almost looks like a miniature of the grand door from the Great Room - metal blue panels with white-and-yellow veins - is embedded in the rock. In the Middle Eastern style, the top of the door is a semicircle.

To the west you see a thick metal door.

In the center of the room, taking up the majority of the space in the room is a giant fish tank. The bottom half meter of the tank is black glass, presumably hiding the inner workings of the tank. Above the base, the glass tank walls extend up for another two meters. There does not appear to be a lid, but a sign next to the tank says in red, "NO MOLLUSCS IN THE TANK." Half submerged in the sand at the bottom of the fish tank, a small metal object glints and sparkles in the light.

The fish, though hesitant at first, wolfs down the crumbs in a matter of seconds and wiggles happily. I'm sure it would be inclined to help you out if you ever needed anything fish-related.

You reach above the glass lip with a tentacle and drop the fish into the water. It gives you a little wink and dives to the bottom of the tank, disappearing into the reef. A few seconds later a small silver key flies out of the water and hits you square between the eyes, falling to the floor.

You reach out with your tentacles, and grasp the four keys and four doorknobs. All at once, you turn them to the right. The great doors ease open with a slight creek as the world around you fades into a white nothingness, and you stand alone in a smooth plane. You are a free octopus.

I'll release you for now. If you bring me a present next year I might consider turning you back into a human.

The couch, lying to your left in front of the door, sags with (fake) age, and it's got tears in the tattered fabric in some places.

Cobble Wall
You push through the door, and find yourself in a tiny room. To your left a cobblestone wall stretches up high above, ending just before the ceiling. Rocks here and there seem to have fallen out of the wall over the ages it has stood in place, creating holes of varying sizes throughout the surface.

To the north you can see the door you came through earlier.

In the center of the wall to the east, you can see a hole as average as yourself. It's so normal it's disappointing.

To the southeast, you can see a miniscule hole, barely larger than your average United State dime, a ten-cent coin, one tenth of a United States dollar, labeled formally as "one dime". The denomination was first authorized by the Coinage Act of 1792. The dime is the smallest in diameter and is the thinnest of all U.S. coins currently minted for circulation, being 0.705 inches (17.91 millimeters) in diameter and 0.053 in (1.35 mm) in thickness. The hole is that size.

To the northeast, you see a hole roughly the size of a fist, punched through the rock in a feat of strength, possibly in frustration, possibly with this game.

You arrive in a long room full of thousands and thousands of bookshelves, filled to the brim with dust-covered tomes. An ancient library, with books on topics much too complex for you to understand. The shelves continue further south.

Behind you to the west, you see a rocky door in the wall.

To the east you see a thick metal door, its industrial design a strange contrast to the otherwise ancient architecture you've encountered in this world so far.

Extruded from the door is a safe labeled "KEY", held closed by a 5-digit combination lock. There's a decimal point between the third and fourth digit of the number, which is odd for a combination lock.

Library
You arrive in a long room full of thousands and thousands of bookshelves, filled to the brim with dust-covered tomes. An ancient library, with books on topics much too complex for you to understand. The shelves continue further south.

Behind you to the west, you see a rocky door in the wall.

To the east you see a thick metal door, its industrial design a strange contrast to the otherwise ancient architecture you've encountered in this world so far.

Extruded from the door is a safe labeled "KEY", held closed by a 5-digit combination lock. There's a decimal point between the third and fourth digit of the number, which is odd for a combination lock.

Library (Shelf #1)
This section of the library is much the same as all the rest: shelves of books to either side, untouched books lying on their shelves. The main room is back to the north, and the shelves continue south.

Lying on the shelf to your left, a dustless green tome lies on its side. Gold lettering on its spine reads "The Dialogues of Plato." Lower down, its call number is printed: 184.2.

Standing on the right shelf, a tome with a suspicious amount of dust rests on the right shelf. Silver lettering on its spine reads "The Great Transformation," and below that its call number is written "200.9."

Cobble Wall
You push through the door, and find yourself in a tiny room.

To the north you can see the door you came through earlier.

In the center of the wall to the east, you can see a hole as average as yourself. It's so normal it's disappointing.

To the southeast, you can see a miniscule hole, barely larger than your average United State dime, a ten-cent coin, one tenth of a United States dollar, labeled formally as "one dime". The denomination was first authorized by the Coinage Act of 1792. The dime is the smallest in diameter and is the thinnest of all U.S. coins currently minted for circulation, being 0.705 inches (17.91 millimeters) in diameter and 0.053 in (1.35 mm) in thickness. The hole is that size.

To the northeast, you see a hole roughly the size of a fist, punched through the rock in a feat of strength, possibly in frustration, possibly with this game.

To your left a cobblestone wall stretches up high above, ending just before the ceiling. Rocks here and there seem to have fallen out of the wall over the ages it has stood in place, creating holes of varying sizes throughout the surface.

Cobble Wall
You push through the door, and find yourself in a thin, wide room that ends abruptly in front you in an ancient cobblestone wall. The wall stretches up high above, ending just before the ceiling. Rocks here and there seem to have fallen out of the wall over the ages it has stood in place, creating holes of varying sizes in the walls (though as I believe I've made clear, it's not actually ancient because it's fake so the holes have been there since I created it).

To the north you can see the door you came through earlier.

Directly in front of you - to the east, imbicile - you see a hole as average as yourself. It's so normal it's dissapointing.

To the southeast, you can see a miniscule hole, barely larger than your average United State dime, a ten-cent coin, one tenth of a United States dollar, labeled formally as "one dime".

To the north you can see the door you came through earlier.

In the center of the wall to the east, you can see a hole as average as yourself. It's so normal it's disappointing.

To the northeast, you see a hole roughly the size of a fist, punched through the rock in a feat of strength, possibly in frustration, possibly with this game.

Library
You arrive in a long room full of thousands and thousands of bookshelves, filled to the brim with dust-covered tomes. An ancient library, with books on topics much too complex for you to understand. The shelves continue further south.

Behind you to the west, you see a rocky door in the wall.

To the east you see a thick metal door, its industrial design a strange contrast to the otherwise ancient architecture you've encountered in this world so far.

Extruded from the door is a safe labeled "KEY", held closed by a 5-digit combination lock. There's a decimal point between the third and fourth digit of the number, which is odd for a combination lock.

Aquarium
You push through the door, and find yourself in a drastically different room with plain concrete walls and a black floor flecked with gray spots. The ceiling looks basically the same as the walls from where you're standing, but between you and me, it's a "living roof" - a roof with a grass on top.

To the west you see a thick metal door.

In the center of the room, taking up the majority of the space in the room is a giant fish tank. The first half meter of the tank is black glass, presumably hiding the inner workings of the tank. Above the base, the glass tank walls extend up for two meters. There does not appear to be a lid, but a sign next to the tank says in red, "NO MOLLUSCS IN THE TANK."

Cobble Wall
You push through the door, and find yourself in a tiny room. To your left a cobblestone wall stretches up high above, ending just before the ceiling. Rocks here and there seem to have fallen out of the wall over the ages it has stood in place, creating holes of varying sizes throughout the surface.

To the north you can see the door you came through earlier.

In the center of the wall to the east, you can see a hole as average as yourself. It's so normal it's disappointing.

To the southeast, you can see a miniscule hole, barely larger than your average United State dime, a ten-cent coin, one tenth of a United States dollar, labeled formally as "one dime". The denomination was first authorized by the Coinage Act of 1792. The dime is the smallest in diameter and is the thinnest of all U.S. coins currently minted for circulation, being 0.705 inches (17.91 millimeters) in diameter and 0.053 in (1.35 mm) in thickness.

Rocks here and there seem to have fallen out of the wall over the ages it has stood in place, creating fist-sized holes in the walls (though as I believe I've made clear, it's not actually ancient because it's fake so the holes have been there since I created it).

Tunnel
The wall stretches up high above, ending just before the ceiling. Rocks here and there seem to have fallen out of the wall over the ages it has stood in place, creating fist-sized holes in the walls (though as I believe I've made clear, it's not actually ancient because it's fake so the holes have been there since I created it).

Cobble Wall
A thin, wide room that ends abruptly in front you in an ancient cobblestone wall.

The wall stretches up high above, ending just before the ceiling. Rocks here and there seem to have fallen out of the wall over the ages it has stood in place, creating fist-sized holes in the walls (though as I believe I've made clear, it's not actually ancient because it's fake so the holes have been there since I created it).

To the north you can see the door you came through earlier.

Cobble Wall
You push through the door, and find yourself in a tiny room. To your left a cobblestone wall stretches up high above, ending just before the ceiling. Rocks here and there seem to have fallen out of the wall over the ages it has stood in place, creating holes of varying sizes throughout the surface.

To the north you can see the door you came through earlier.

In the center of the wall to the east, you can see a hole as average as yourself. It's so normal it's disappointing.

To the southeast, you can see a miniscule hole, barely larger than your average United State dime, a ten-cent coin, one tenth of a United States dollar, labeled formally as "one dime". The denomination was first authorized by the Coinage Act of 1792. The dime is the smallest in diameter and is the thinnest of all U.S. coins currently minted for circulation, being 0.705 inches (17.91 millimeters) in diameter and 0.053 in (1.35 mm) in thickness. The hole is that size.

To the northeast, you see a hole roughly the size of a fist, punched through the rock in a feat of strength, possibly in frustration, possibly with this game.

Library
You arrive in a long room full of thousands and thousands of bookshelves, filled to the brim with dust-covered tomes. An ancient library, with books on topics much too complex for you to understand. The shelves continue further south.

Behind you to the west, you see a rocky door in the wall.

To the east you see a thick metal door, its industrial design a strange contrast to the otherwise ancient architecture you've encountered in this world so far.

Extruded from the door is a safe labeled "KEY", held closed by a 5-digit combination lock. There's a decimal point between the third and fourth digit of the number, which is odd for a combination lock.

Aquarium
You push through the door, and find yourself in a drastically different room with plain concrete walls and a black floor flecked with gray spots. The ceiling looks basically the same as the walls from where you're standing, but between you and me, it's a "living roof" - a roof with a grass on top.

To the west you see a thick metal door.

In the center of the room, taking up the majority of the space in the room is a giant fish tank. The first half meter of the tank is black glass, presumably hiding the inner workings of the tank. Above the base, the glass tank walls extend up for two meters. There does not appear to be a lid, but a sign next to the tank says in red, "NO MOLLUSCS IN THE TANK." Half submerged in the sand at the bottom of the fish tank, a small metal object glints and sparkles in the light.

A grand room built from giant blocks of a sand-colored stone, stacked up to a ceiling high above where a massive compass lays embedded in the rock.

Behind you to the west you see a hallway, hewn out of the stone, leading  to another room.

To the south, a small blue door is embedded in the rock.

Before you to the east, taking up almost the entire wall, is a great metal door painted a deep blue and patterned with yellow and white veins that run throughout. At the base of the door are four keyholes and four doorknobs.

Cobble Wall
You push through the door, and find yourself in a thin, wide room that ends abruptly in front you in an ancient cobblestone wall. The wall stretches up high above, ending just before the ceiling. Rocks here and there seem to have fallen out of the wall over the ages it has stood in place, creating holes of varying sizes in the walls (though as I believe I've made clear, it's not actually ancient because it's fake so the holes have been there since I created it).

To the north you can see the door you came through earlier.

Directly in front of you you see a hole as average as yourself. It's so normal it's dissapointing.

To your right you see a miniscule hole, barely larger than your average United State dime, a ten-cent coin, one tenth of a United States dollar, labeled formally as "one dime". The denomination was first authorized by the Coinage Act of 1792. The dime is the smallest in diameter and is the thinnest of all U.S. coins currently minted for circulation, being 0.705 inches (17.91 millimeters) in diameter and 0.053 in (1.35 mm) in thickness. The hole looks like that.

To your left you see a hole roughly the size of a fist, punched through the rock in a feat of strength far out of reach of one such as yourself.

Library
Frustrated, you arrive in a room full of thousands and thousands of books. Just as the thought crosses your mind, you hear that voice again.

"It's not a room full of books, you imbecile. It's a library."

That would make sense. To the east you see a hallway continuing into the next room.

On the wall is a giant sign that says "PUZZLE INOPERABLE."

In the center of the wall you can see a hole as average as yourself. It's so normal it's dissapointing.

Cobble Wall
You push through the door, and find yourself in a tiny room. To your left a cobblestone wall stretches up high above, ending just before the ceiling. Rocks here and there seem to have fallen out of the wall over the ages it has stood in place, creating holes of varying sizes throughout the surface.

To the north you can see the door you came through earlier.

In the center of the wall to the east, you can see a hole as average as yourself. It's so normal it's disappointing.

To the southeast, you can see a miniscule hole, barely larger than your average United State dime, a ten-cent coin, one tenth of a United States dollar, labeled formally as "one dime". The denomination was first authorized by the Coinage Act of 1792. The dime is the smallest in diameter and is the thinnest of all U.S. coins currently minted for circulation, being 0.705 inches (17.91 millimeters) in diameter and 0.053 in (1.35 mm) in thickness. The hole is that size.

To the northeast, you see a hole roughly the size of a fist, punched through the rock in a feat of strength, possibly in frustration, possibly with this game.

Library
You arrive in a long room full of thousands and thousands of bookshelves, full to the brim with dust-covered tomes. An ancient library, with books on topics much to complex for you to understand. The shelves continue further south.

Behind you to the west, you see a rocky door in the wall.

To the east you see a thick metal door, its industrial design a strange contrast to the otherwise ancient design you've encountered in this world so far. Extruded from the door is a box labeled "KEY", apparently held closed by a 2-digit combination lock, which is a little odd for state-of-the-art security.

This section of the library is much the same as all the rest: shelves of books to either side, untouched books lying on their shelves. Two books seem to stand out, less dusty than the rest.

Lying on the shelf to your left, a dustless green tome lies on its side. Gold lettering on its spine reads "THE DIALOGUES OF PLATO." Lower down, its call number is printed: 184.26.

Standing on the right shelf, a tome with a suspicious amount of dust rests on the right shelf. Silver lettering on its spine reads "THE GREAT TRANSFORMATION," and below that its call number is written "200.9."

"Socrates" ancient words are still true, and the ideas found in Plato's Dialogues still form the foundation of a thinking person's education. This superb collection contains excellent contemporary translations selected for their clarity and accessibility to today's reader, as well as an incisive introduction by Erich Segal, which reveals Plato's life and clarifies the philosophical issues examined in each dialogue. The first four dialogues recount the trial and execution of Socrates-the extraordinary tragedy that changed Plato's life and forever altered the course of Western thought. Other dialogues create a rich tableau of intellectual life in Athens in the fourth century b.c., and examine such timeless-and timely-issues as the nature of virtue and love, knowledge and truth, society and the individual. Resounding with the humor and astounding brilliance of Socrates, the immortal iconoclast, these great works remain powerful, probing, and essential."

Aquarium
You push through the door, and find yourself in a drastically different room with plain concrete walls and a black floor flecked with gray spots. The ceiling looks basically the same as the walls from where you're standing, but between you and me, it's a "living roof" - a roof with a grass on top.

To the west you see a thick metal door.

In the center of the room, taking up the majority of the space in the room is a giant fishtank. The first half meter of the tank is an black wall, presumably hiding the inner workings of the tank. Above the base, the glass tank walls extend up for two meters, where they end at a mesh lid.

Library (Shelf #4)
This section of the library is much the same as all the rest: shelves of books to either side, untouched books lying on their shelves. A small glyph is carved into the wood of a shelf here that looks faintly like an "x," but you can't quite recognize what it is.

In a small gap in the books, a blue book leans across: "Born a Crime." On its spine a call number is printed: 791.4502.

A white and red book lies flat on top of the other books here. Written in black about a great red pirate flag are the words, "Enemy of All Mankind." On its spine, a call number reads "910.45."

Library
A great library, full to the brim with books. The shelves continue further south.

Behind you to the west, you see a rocky door in the wall.

To the east you see a thick metal door, its industrial design a strange contrast to the otherwise ancient design you've encountered in this world so far. Extruded from the door is a box labeled "KEY", apparently held closed by a 2-digit combination lock, which is a little odd for state-of-the-art security.

Cobble Wall
A tiny room that ends abruptly to your left in an ancient cobblestone wall. The wall stretches up high above, ending just before the ceiling. Rocks here and there seem to have fallen out of the wall over the ages it has stood in place, creating holes of varying sizes in the walls (though as I believe I've made clear, it's not actually ancient because it's fake so the holes have been there since I created it).

To the southeast, you can see a miniscule hole, barely larger than your average United State dime, a ten-cent coin, one tenth of a United States dollar, labeled formally as "one dime". The denomination was first authorized by the Coinage Act of 1792. The dime is the smallest in diameter and is the thinnest of all U.S. coins currently minted for circulation, being 0.705 inches (17.91 millimeters) in diameter and 0.053 in (1.35 mm) in thickness. The hole looks like that.

To the north you can see the door you came through earlier.

In the center of the wall you can see a hole as average as yourself. It's so normal it's dissapointing.

In the northeast of the wall, you see a hole roughly the size of a fist, punched through the rock in a feat of strength far out of reach of one such as yourself.

Great Room
A grand room built from giant blocks of a sand-colored stone, stacked up to a ceiling high above where a massive compass lays embedded in the rock.

Behind you to the west you see a hallway, hewn out of the stone, leading  to another room.

To the south, a small blue door is embedded in the rock. In the Middle Eastern style, the top of the door is a semicircle.

Before you to the east, taking up almost the entire wall, is a great metal door painted a deep blue and patterned with yellow and white veins that run throughout. At the base of the door are four keyholes and four doorknobs.

To the south, almost obscured behind a large gray couch, you see a door.

The couch, lying to your left in front of the door, sags with (fake) age, and it's got tears in the tattered fabric in some places.

Cobble Wall
You push through the door, and find yourself in a tiny room. To your left a cobblestone wall stretches up high above, ending just before the ceiling. Rocks here and there seem to have fallen out of the wall over the ages it has stood in place, creating holes of varying sizes throughout the surface.

To the north you can see the door you came through earlier.

In the center of the wall to the east, you can see a hole as average as yourself. It's so normal it's disappointing.

To the southeast, you can see a miniscule hole, barely larger than your average United State dime, a ten-cent coin, one tenth of a United States dollar, labeled formally as "one dime". The denomination was first authorized by the Coinage Act of 1792. The dime is the smallest in diameter and is the thinnest of all U.S. coins currently minted for circulation, being 0.705 inches (17.91 millimeters) in diameter and 0.053 in (1.35 mm) in thickness. The hole is that size.

To the northeast, you see a hole roughly the size of a fist, punched through the rock in a feat of strength, possibly in frustration, possibly with this game.

Library
You arrive in a long room full of thousands and thousands of bookshelves, filled to the brim with dust-covered tomes. An ancient library, with books on topics much too complex for you to understand. The shelves continue further south.

Behind you to the west, you see a rocky door in the wall.

To the east you see a thick metal door, its industrial design a strange contrast to the otherwise ancient architecture you've encountered in this world so far.

Extruded from the door is a safe labeled "KEY", held closed by a 5-digit combination lock. There's a decimal point between the third and fourth digit of the number, which is odd for a combination lock.

Aquarium
You push through the door, and find yourself in a drastically different room with plain concrete walls and a black floor flecked with gray spots. The ceiling looks basically the same as the walls from where you're standing, but between you and me, it's a "living roof" - a roof with a grass on top.

To the north, a door that almost looks like a miniature of the grand door from the Great Room - metal blue panels with white-and-yellow veins - is embedded in the rock. In the Middle Eastern style, the top of the door is a semicircle.

To the west you see a thick metal door.

In the center of the room, taking up the majority of the space in the room is a giant fish tank. The bottom half meter of the tank is black glass, presumably hiding the inner workings of the tank. Above the base, the glass tank walls extend up for another two meters. There does not appear to be a lid, but a sign next to the tank says in red, "NO MOLLUSCS IN THE TANK." Half submerged in the sand at the bottom of the fish tank, a small metal object glints and sparkles in the light.

You reach above the glass lip with a tentacle and drop the fish into the water. It gives you a little wink and dives to the bottom of the tank, disappearing into the reef. A few seconds later a small silver key flies out of the water and hit you square between the eyes, falling to the floor.

I'll release you for now. If you bring me a present next year I might consider turning you back into a human.

Cobble Wall
You push through the door, and find yourself in a tiny room. To your left a cobblestone wall stretches up high above, ending just before the ceiling. Rocks here and there seem to have fallen out of the wall over the ages it has stood in place, creating holes of varying sizes throughout the surface.

To the north you can see the door you came through earlier.

In the center of the wall to the east, you can see a hole as average as yourself. It's so normal it's disappointing.

To the southeast, you can see a miniscule hole, barely larger than your average United State dime, a ten-cent coin, one tenth of a United States dollar, labeled formally as "one dime". The denomination was first authorized by the Coinage Act of 1792. The dime is the smallest in diameter and is the thinnest of all U.S. coins currently minted for circulation, being 0.705 inches (17.91 millimeters) in diameter and 0.053 in (1.35 mm) in thickness. The hole is that size.

To the northeast, you see a hole roughly the size of a fist, punched through the rock in a feat of strength, possibly in frustration, possibly with this game.

Teensy Cave of Fortune
Behind you to the northwest, light streams in from the puny cave's entrance.

In the dust below your feet, a small silver key glints in the dim light.

Cobble Wall
A tiny room. To your left a cobblestone wall stretches up high above, ending just before the ceiling. Rocks here and there seem to have fallen out of the wall over the ages it has stood in place, creating holes of varying sizes throughout the surface.

To the southeast, you can see a miniscule hole, barely larger than your average United State dime, a ten-cent coin, one tenth of a United States dollar, labeled formally as "one dime". The denomination was first authorized by the Coinage Act of 1792. The dime is the smallest in diameter and is the thinnest of all U.S. coins currently minted for circulation, being 0.705 inches (17.91 millimeters) in diameter and 0.053 in (1.35 mm) in thickness. The hole is that size.

To the north you can see the door you came through earlier.

In the center of the wall to the east, you can see a hole as average as yourself. It's so normal it's disappointing.

To the northeast, you see a hole roughly the size of a fist, punched through the rock in a feat of strength, possibly in frustration, possibly with this game.

Extruded from the door is a safe labeled "KEY", held closed by a 5-digit combination lock. There's a decimal point between the third and fourth digit of the number, which is odd for a combination lock.

Aquarium
A large room with plain concrete walls and a black floor flecked with gray spots. The ceiling looks basically the same as the walls from where you're standing, but between you and me, it's a "living roof" - a roof with a grass on top.

To the west you see a thick metal door.

In the center of the room, taking up the majority of the space in the room is a giant fishtank. The first half meter of the tank is an black wall, presumably hiding the inner workings of the tank. Above the base, the glass tank walls extend up for two meters, where they end at a mesh lid.

Cobble Wall
You push through the door, and find yourself in a thin, wide room that ends abruptly in front you in an ancient cobblestone wall. The wall stretches up high above, ending just before the ceiling. Rocks here and there seem to have fallen out of the wall over the ages it has stood in place, creating holes of varying sizes in the walls (though as I believe I've made clear, it's not actually ancient because it's fake so the holes have been there since I created it).

To the north you can see the door you came through earlier.

Directly in front of you - to the east, imbicile - you see a hole as average as yourself. It's so normal it's dissapointing.

To the southeast, you can see a miniscule hole, barely larger than your average United State dime, a ten-cent coin, one tenth of a United States dollar, labeled formally as "one dime". The denomination was first authorized by the Coinage Act of 1792. The dime is the smallest in diameter and is the thinnest of all U.S. coins currently minted for circulation, being 0.705 inches (17.91 millimeters) in diameter and 0.053 in (1.35 mm) in thickness. The hole looks like that.

In the northeast of the wall, you see a hole roughly the size of a fist, punched through the rock in a feat of strength far out of reach of one such as yourself.

Great Room
A grand room built from giant blocks of a sand-colored stone, stacked up to a ceiling high above where a massive compass lays embedded in the rock.

Behind you to the west you see a hallway, hewn out of the stone, leading  to another room.

Before you to the east, taking up almost the entire wall, is a great metal door painted a deep blue and patterned with yellow and white veins that run throughout. At the base of the door are four keyholes and four doorknobs.

Library
You arrive in a long room full of thousands and thousands of bookshelves, full to the brim with dust-covered tomes. An ancient library, with books on topics much to complex for you to understand. The shelves continue further south.

Behind you to the west, you see a rocky door in the wall.

To the east you see a thick metal door, its industrial design a strange contrast to the otherwise ancient design you've encountered in this world so far. Extruded from the door is a box labeled "KEY", apparently held closed by a 2-digit combination lock, which is a little odd for state-of-the-art security.

Cobble Wall
You push through the door, and find yourself in a tiny room. To your left a cobblestone wall stretches up high above, ending just before the ceiling. Rocks here and there seem to have fallen out of the wall over the ages it has stood in place, creating holes of varying sizes throughout the surface.

To the north you can see the door you came through earlier.

In the center of the wall to the east, you can see a hole as average as yourself. It's so normal it's disappointing.

To the southeast, you can see a miniscule hole, barely larger than your average United State dime, a ten-cent coin, one tenth of a United States dollar, labeled formally as "one dime". The denomination was first authorized by the Coinage Act of 1792. The dime is the smallest in diameter and is the thinnest of all U.S. coins currently minted for circulation, being 0.705 inches (17.91 millimeters) in diameter and 0.053 in (1.35 mm) in thickness. The hole is that size.

To the northeast, you see a hole roughly the size of a fist, punched through the rock in a feat of strength, possibly in frustration, possibly with this game.

Great Room
A grand room built from giant blocks of a sand-colored stone, stacked up to a ceiling high above where a massive compass lays embedded in the rock.

Behind you to the west you see a hallway, hewn out of the stone, leading  to another room.

Before you to the east, taking up almost the entire wall, is a great metal door painted a deep blue and patterned with yellow and white veins that run throughout. At the base of the door are four keyholes and four doorknobs.

To the south, almost obscured behind a large gray couch, you see a door.

The couch, lying to your left in front of the door, sags with (fake) age, and it's got tears in the tattered fabric in some places.

Library
You arrive in a long room full of thousands and thousands of bookshelves, filled to the brim with dust-covered tomes. An ancient library, with books on topics much too complex for you to understand. The shelves continue further south.

Behind you to the west, you see a rocky door in the wall.

To the east you see a thick metal door, its industrial design a strange contrast to the otherwise ancient architecture you've encountered in this world so far.

Extruded from the door is a safe labeled "KEY", held closed by a 5-digit combination lock. There's a decimal point between the third and fourth digit of the number, which is odd for a combination lock.

Aquarium
You push through the door, and find yourself in a drastically different room with plain concrete walls and a black floor flecked with gray spots. The ceiling looks basically the same as the walls from where you're standing, but between you and me, it's a "living roof" - a roof with a grass on top.

To the west you see a thick metal door.

In the center of the room, taking up the majority of the space in the room is a giant fish tank. The first half meter of the tank is black glass, presumably hiding the inner workings of the tank. Above the base, the glass tank walls extend up for two meters. There does not appear to be a lid, but a sign next to the tank says in red, "NO MOLLUSCS IN THE TANK." Half submerged in the sand at the bottom of the fish tank, a small metal object glints and sparkles in the light.

Cobble Wall
You push through the door, and find yourself in a tiny room. To your left a cobblestone wall stretches up high above, ending just before the ceiling. Rocks here and there seem to have fallen out of the wall over the ages it has stood in place, creating holes of varying sizes throughout the surface.

To the north you can see the door you came through earlier.

In the center of the wall to the east, you can see a hole as average as yourself. It's so normal it's disappointing.

To the southeast, you can see a miniscule hole, barely larger than your average United State dime, a ten-cent coin, one tenth of a United States dollar, labeled formally as "one dime". The denomination was first authorized by the Coinage Act of 1792. The dime is the smallest in diameter and is the thinnest of all U.S. coins currently minted for circulation, being 0.705 inches (17.91 millimeters) in diameter and 0.053 in (1.35 mm) in thickness. The hole is that size.

To the northeast, you see a hole roughly the size of a fist, punched through the rock in a feat of strength, possibly in frustration, possibly with this game.

Behind you to the northwest, light streams in from the puny cave's entrance.

In the dust below your feet, a small silver key glints in the dim light.

Library
You arrive in a long room full of thousands and thousands of bookshelves, filled to the brim with dust-covered tomes. An ancient library, with books on topics much too complex for you to understand. The shelves continue further south.

Behind you to the west, you see a rocky door in the wall.

To the east you see a thick metal door, its industrial design a strange contrast to the otherwise ancient architecture you've encountered in this world so far.

Extruded from the door is a safe labeled "KEY", held closed by a 5-digit combination lock. There's a decimal point between the third and fourth digit of the number, which is odd for a combination lock.

You push through the door, and find yourself in a tiny room. To your left a cobblestone wall stretches up high above, ending just before the ceiling. Rocks here and there seem to have fallen out of the wall over the ages it has stood in place, creating holes of varying sizes throughout the surface.

To the north you can see the door you came through earlier.

In the center of the wall to the east, you can see a hole as average as yourself. It's so normal it's disappointing.

To the southeast, you can see a miniscule hole, barely larger than your average United State dime, a ten-cent coin, one tenth of a United States dollar, labeled formally as "one dime". The denomination was first authorized by the Coinage Act of 1792. The dime is the smallest in diameter and is the thinnest of all U.S. coins currently minted for circulation, being 0.705 inches (17.91 millimeters) in diameter and 0.053 in (1.35 mm) in thickness. The hole is that size.

To the northeast, you see a hole roughly the size of a fist, punched through the rock in a feat of strength, possibly in frustration, possibly with this game.

To the west you see a thick metal door.

In the center of the room, taking up the majority of the space in the room is a giant fish tank. The first half meter of the tank is black glass, presumably hiding the inner workings of the tank. Above the base, the glass tank walls extend up for two meters. There does not appear to be a lid, but a sign next to the tank says in red, "NO MOLLUSCS IN THE TANK." Half submerged in the sand at the bottom of the fish tank, a small metal object glints and sparkles in the light.

You reach above the glass lip with a tentacle and drop the fish into the water. It gives you a little wink and dives to the bottom of the tank, dissappearing into the reef. A few seconds later, a pair of keys fly out of the water and hit you square between the eyes.

Great Room
A grand room built from giant blocks of a sand-colored stone, stacked up to a ceiling high above where a massive compass lays embedded in the rock.

To the south, a small blue door is embedded in the rock.

Behind you to the west you see a hallway, hewn out of the stone, leading  to another room.

Before you to the east, taking up almost the entire wall, is a great metal door painted a deep blue and patterned with yellow and white veins that run throughout. At the base of the door are four keyholes and four doorknobs.

I'll release you for now. If you bring me a present next year I might consider turning you back into a human.

Cobble Wall
You push through the door, and find yourself in a tiny room. To your left a cobblestone wall stretches up high above, ending just before the ceiling. Rocks here and there seem to have fallen out of the wall over the ages it has stood in place, creating holes of varying sizes throughout the surface.

To the north you can see the door you came through earlier.

In the center of the wall to the east, you can see a hole as average as yourself. It's so normal it's disappointing.

To the southeast, you can see a miniscule hole, barely larger than your average United State dime, a ten-cent coin, one tenth of a United States dollar, labeled formally as "one dime". The denomination was first authorized by the Coinage Act of 1792. The dime is the smallest in diameter and is the thinnest of all U.S. coins currently minted for circulation, being 0.705 inches (17.91 millimeters) in diameter and 0.053 in (1.35 mm) in thickness. The hole is that size.

To the northeast, you see a hole roughly the size of a fist, punched through the rock in a feat of strength, possibly in frustration, possibly with this game.

Library
You arrive in a long room full of thousands and thousands of bookshelves, filled to the brim with dust-covered tomes. An ancient library, with books on topics much too complex for you to understand. The shelves continue further south.

Behind you to the west, you see a rocky door in the wall.

To the east you see a thick metal door, its industrial design a strange contrast to the otherwise ancient architecture you've encountered in this world so far.

Extruded from the door is a safe labeled "KEY", held closed by a 5-digit combination lock. There's a decimal point between the third and fourth digit of the number, which is odd for a combination lock.

Aquarium
You push through the door, and find yourself in a drastically different room with plain concrete walls and a black floor flecked with gray spots. The ceiling looks basically the same as the walls from where you're standing, but between you and me, it's a "living roof" - a roof with a grass on top.

To the west you see a thick metal door.

In the center of the room, taking up the majority of the space in the room is a giant fish tank. The first half meter of the tank is black glass, presumably hiding the inner workings of the tank. Above the base, the glass tank walls extend up for two meters. There does not appear to be a lid, but a sign next to the tank says in red, "NO MOLLUSCS IN THE TANK." Half submerged in the sand at the bottom of the fish tank, a small metal object glints and sparkles in the light.

Cluttered Room
A room, half the size of the previous room, filled to the brim with chairs, folded tables, closed crates, and smaller tidbits scattered about.

To the south, almost obscured behind a large gray couch, you see a door.

Behind you to the east you see a hallway, hewn out of the stone, leading  to another room.

To your right you see a dented bucket overflowing with junk. Or maybe it's important items for progressing in the game.

The couch, lying to your left in front of the door, sags with (fake) age, and it's got tears in the tattered fabric in some places.

Cobble Wall
A tiny room. To your left a cobblestone wall stretches up high above, ending just before the ceiling. Rocks here and there seem to have fallen out of the wall over the ages it has stood in place, creating holes of varying sizes throughout the surface.

To the north you can see the door you came through earlier.

To the southeast, you can see a miniscule hole, barely larger than your average United State dime, a ten-cent coin, one tenth of a United States dollar, labeled formally as "one dime". The denomination was first authorized by the Coinage Act of 1792. The dime is the smallest in diameter and is the thinnest of all U.S. coins currently minted for circulation, being 0.705 inches (17.91 millimeters) in diameter and 0.053 in (1.35 mm) in thickness. The hole is that size.

In the center of the wall to the east, you can see a hole as average as yourself. It's so normal it's disappointing.

To the northeast, you see a hole roughly the size of a fist, punched through the rock in a feat of strength, possibly in frustration, possibly with this game.

Library
You arrive in a long room full of thousands and thousands of bookshelves, filled to the brim with dust-covered tomes. An ancient library, with books on topics much too complex for you to understand. The shelves continue further south.

Behind you to the west, you see a rocky door in the wall.

To the east you see a thick metal door, its industrial design a strange contrast to the otherwise ancient architecture you've encountered in this world so far.

Extruded from the door is a safe labeled "KEY", held closed by a 5-digit combination lock. There's a decimal point between the third and fourth digit of the number, which is odd for a combination lock.

Aquarium
You push through the door, and find yourself in a drastically different room with plain concrete walls and a black floor flecked with gray spots. The ceiling looks basically the same as the walls from where you're standing, but between you and me, it's a "living roof" - a roof with a grass on top.

To the west you see a thick metal door.

In the center of the room, taking up the majority of the space in the room is a giant fish tank. The first half meter of the tank is black glass, presumably hiding the inner workings of the tank. Above the base, the glass tank walls extend up for two meters. There does not appear to be a lid, but a sign next to the tank says in red, "NO MOLLUSCS IN THE TANK." Half submerged in the sand at the bottom of the fish tank, a small metal object glints and sparkles in the light.

To the north you can see the door you came through earlier.

In the center of the wall to the east, you can see a hole as average as yourself. It's so normal it's disappointing.

To the southeast, you can see a miniscule hole, barely larger than your average United State dime, a ten-cent coin, one tenth of a United States dollar, labeled formally as "one dime". The denomination was first authorized by the Coinage Act of 1792. The dime is the smallest in diameter and is the thinnest of all U.S. coins currently minted for circulation, being 0.705 inches (17.91 millimeters) in diameter and 0.053 in (1.35 mm) in thickness. The hole is that size.

To the northeast, you see a hole roughly the size of a fist, punched through the rock in a feat of strength, possibly in frustration, possibly with this game.

Aquarium
You push through the door, and find yourself in a drastically different room with plain concrete walls and a black floor flecked with gray spots. The ceiling looks basically the same as the walls from where you're standing, but between you and me, it's a "living roof" - a roof with a grass on top.

To the north, a door that almost looks like a miniature of the grand door from the Great Room - metal blue panels with white-and-yellow veins - is embedded in the rock. In the Middle Eastern style, the top of the door is a semicircle.

To the west you see a thick metal door.

In the center of the room, taking up the majority of the space in the room is a giant fish tank. The bottom half meter of the tank is black glass, presumably hiding the inner workings of the tank. Above the base, the glass tank walls extend up for another two meters. There does not appear to be a lid, but a sign next to the tank says in red, "NO MOLLUSCS IN THE TANK." Half submerged in the sand at the bottom of the fish tank, a small metal object glints and sparkles in the light.

Great Room
A grand room built from giant blocks of a sand-colored stone, stacked up to a ceiling high above where a massive compass lays embedded in the rock.

To the south, a small blue door is embedded in the rock.

Behind you to the west you see a hallway, hewn out of the stone, leading  to another room.

Before you to the east, taking up almost the entire wall, is a great metal door painted a deep blue and patterned with yellow and white veins that run throughout. At the base of the door are four keyholes and four doorknobs.

To your right you see a dented bucket overflowing with junk. Or maybe it's important items for progressing in the game.

The couch, lying to your left in front of the door, sags with (fake) age, and it's got tears in the tattered fabric in some places.

Cobble Wall
You push through the door, and find yourself in a tiny room. To your left a cobblestone wall stretches up high above, ending just before the ceiling. Rocks here and there seem to have fallen out of the wall over the ages it has stood in place, creating holes of varying sizes throughout the surface.

To the north you can see the door you came through earlier.

In the center of the wall to the east, you can see a hole as average as yourself. It's so normal it's disappointing.

To the southeast, you can see a miniscule hole, barely larger than your average United State dime, a ten-cent coin, one tenth of a United States dollar, labeled formally as "one dime". The denomination was first authorized by the Coinage Act of 1792. The dime is the smallest in diameter and is the thinnest of all U.S. coins currently minted for circulation, being 0.705 inches (17.91 millimeters) in diameter and 0.053 in (1.35 mm) in thickness. The hole is that size.

To the northeast, you see a hole roughly the size of a fist, punched through the rock in a feat of strength, possibly in frustration, possibly with this game.

Library
You arrive in a long room full of thousands and thousands of bookshelves, filled to the brim with dust-covered tomes. An ancient library, with books on topics much too complex for you to understand. The shelves continue further south.

Behind you to the west, you see a rocky door in the wall.

To the east you see a thick metal door, its industrial design a strange contrast to the otherwise ancient architecture you've encountered in this world so far.

Extruded from the door is a safe labeled "KEY", held closed by a 5-digit combination lock. There's a decimal point between the third and fourth digit of the number, which is odd for a combination lock.

Aquarium
A large room with plain concrete walls and a black floor flecked with gray spots. The ceiling looks basically the same as the walls from where you're standing, but between you and me, it's a "living roof" - a roof with a grass on top.

To the west you see a thick metal door.

In the center of the room, taking up the majority of the space in the room is a giant fishtank. The first half meter of the tank is an black wall, presumably hiding the inner workings of the tank. Above the base, the glass tank walls extend up for two meters, where they end at a mesh lid.

Cobble Wall
You push through the door, and find yourself in a tiny room that ends abruptly to your left in an ancient cobblestone wall. The wall stretches up high above, ending just before the ceiling. Rocks here and there seem to have fallen out of the wall over the ages it has stood in place, creating holes of varying sizes in the walls (though as I believe I've made clear, it's not actually ancient because it's fake so the holes have been there since I created it).

To the north you can see the door you came through earlier.

In the center of the wall to the east, you can see a hole as average as yourself. It's so normal it's dissapointing.

To the southeast, you can see a miniscule hole, barely larger than your average United State dime, a ten-cent coin, one tenth of a United States dollar, labeled formally as "one dime". The denomination was first authorized by the Coinage Act of 1792. The dime is the smallest in diameter and is the thinnest of all U.S. coins currently minted for circulation, being 0.705 inches (17.91 millimeters) in diameter and 0.053 in (1.35 mm) in thickness. The hole looks like that.

In the northeast of the wall, you see a hole roughly the size of a fist, punched through the rock in a feat of strength far out of reach of one such as yourself.

Cobble Wall
A tiny room that ends abruptly to your left in an ancient cobblestone wall. The wall stretches up high above, ending just before the ceiling. Rocks here and there seem to have fallen out of the wall over the ages it has stood in place, creating holes of varying sizes in the walls (though as I believe I've made clear, it's not actually ancient because it's fake so the holes have been there since I created it).

To the southeast, you can see a miniscule hole, barely larger than your average United State dime, a ten-cent coin, one tenth of a United States dollar, labeled formally as "one dime". The denomination was first authorized by the Coinage Act of 1792.

Library
You arrive in a long room full of thousands and thousands of bookshelves, full to the brim with dust-covered tomes. An ancient library, with books on topics much to complex for you to understand. The shelves continue further south.

Behind you to the west, you see a rocky door in the wall.

To the east you see a thick metal door, its industrial design a strange contrast to the otherwise ancient design you've encountered in this world so far. Extruded from the door is a box labeled "KEY", apparently held closed by a 2-digit combination lock, which is a little odd for state-of-the-art security.

Cobble Wall
You push through the door, and find yourself in a tiny room. To your left a cobblestone wall stretches up high above, ending just before the ceiling. Rocks here and there seem to have fallen out of the wall over the ages it has stood in place, creating holes of varying sizes throughout the surface.

To the north you can see the door you came through earlier.

In the center of the wall to the east, you can see a hole as average as yourself. It's so normal it's disappointing.

To the southeast, you can see a miniscule hole, barely larger than your average United State dime, a ten-cent coin, one tenth of a United States dollar, labeled formally as "one dime". The denomination was first authorized by the Coinage Act of 1792. The dime is the smallest in diameter and is the thinnest of all U.S. coins currently minted for circulation, being 0.705 inches (17.91 millimeters) in diameter and 0.053 in (1.35 mm) in thickness. The hole is that size.

To the northeast, you see a hole roughly the size of a fist, punched through the rock in a feat of strength, possibly in frustration, possibly with this game.

Aquarium
You push through the door, and find yourself in a drastically different room with plain concrete walls and a black floor flecked with gray spots. The ceiling looks basically the same as the walls from where you're standing, but between you and me, it's a "living roof" - a roof with a grass on top.

To the west you see a thick metal door.

In the center of the room, taking up the majority of the space in the room is a giant fish tank. The first half meter of the tank is black glass, presumably hiding the inner workings of the tank. Above the base, the glass tank walls extend up for two meters. There does not appear to be a lid, but a sign next to the tank says in red, "NO MOLLUSCS IN THE TANK." Half submerged in the sand at the bottom of the fish tank, a small metal object glints and sparkles in the light.

You're yanked out of the water, and the soldiers slap cuffs on your tentacles as they take you away.

That was quite foolish of you. Can't you read?

Cobble Wall
You push through the door, and find yourself in a thin, wide room that ends abruptly in front you in an ancient cobblestone wall. The wall stretches up high above, ending just before the ceiling. Rocks here and there seem to have fallen out of the wall over the ages it has stood in place, creating holes of varying sizes in the walls (though as I believe I've made clear, it's not actually ancient because it's fake so the holes have been there since I created it).

To the north you can see the door you came through earlier.

Directly in front of you - to the east, imbicile - you see a hole as average as yourself. It's so normal it's dissapointing.

To the southeast, you can see a miniscule hole, barely larger than your average United State dime, a ten-cent coin, one tenth of a United States dollar, labeled formally as "one dime". The denomination was first authorized by the Coinage Act of 1792. The dime is the smallest in diameter and is the thinnest of all U.S. coins currently minted for circulation, being 0.705 inches (17.91 millimeters) in diameter and 0.053 in (1.35 mm) in thickness. The hole looks like that.

In the northeast of the wall, you see a hole roughly the size of a fist, punched through the rock in a feat of strength far out of reach of one such as yourself.

Maze
You land in the next room just beyond the exit of the hallway, and the ground rumbles as it collapses behind you. You find yourself in what seems to be an ancient cobblestone maze. Rocks here and there seem to have fallen out of the wall over the ages it has stood in place, creating fist-sized holes in the walls. The path extends out to the east and west to either side. To the east you see a hallway continuing into the next room.

On the wall is a giant sign that says "PUZZLE INOPERABLE."

To the south, almost obscured behind a large gray couch, you see a closed door.

Great Room
A grand room built from giant blocks of a sand-colored stone, stacked up to a ceiling high above where a massive compass lays embedded in the rock. Back to the west you see a hallway, hewn out of the stone, leading to another room.

Before you to the east, taking up almost the entire wall, is a great metal door painted a deep blue and patterned with yellow and white veins that run throughout. At the base of the door are eight large keyholes.

Cobble Wall
You push through the door, and find yourself in a tiny room that ends abruptly to your left in an ancient cobblestone wall. The wall stretches up high above, ending just before the ceiling. Rocks here and there seem to have fallen out of the wall over the ages it has stood in place, creating holes of varying sizes in the walls (though as I believe I've made clear, it's not actually ancient because it's fake so the holes have been there since I created it).

To the north you can see the door you came through earlier.

In the center of the wall to the east, you can see a hole as average as yourself. It's so normal it's dissapointing.

To the southeast, you can see a miniscule hole, barely larger than your average United State dime, a ten-cent coin, one tenth of a United States dollar, labeled formally as "one dime". The denomination was first authorized by the Coinage Act of 1792. The dime is the smallest in diameter and is the thinnest of all U.S. coins currently minted for circulation, being 0.705 inches (17.91 millimeters) in diameter and 0.053 in (1.35 mm) in thickness. The hole looks like that.

In the northeast of the wall, you see a hole roughly the size of a fist, punched through the rock in a feat of strength far out of reach of one such as yourself.

Cobble Wall
A tiny room that ends abruptly to your left in an ancient cobblestone wall. The wall stretches up high above, ending just before the ceiling. Rocks here and there seem to have fallen out of the wall over the ages it has stood in place, creating holes of varying sizes in the walls (though as I believe I've made clear, it's not actually ancient because it's fake so the holes have been there since I created it).

To the southeast, you can see a miniscule hole, barely larger than your average United State dime, a ten-cent coin, one tenth of a United States dollar, labeled formally as "one dime". The denomination was first authorized by the Coinage Act of 1792. The dime is the smallest in diameter and is the thinnest of all U.S. coins currently minted for circulation, being 0.705 inches (17.91 millimeters) in diameter and 0.053 in (1.35 mm) in thickness. The hole looks like that.

To the north you can see the door you came through earlier.

In the center of the wall to the east, you can see a hole as average as yourself. It's so normal it's dissapointing.

In the northeast of the wall, you see a hole roughly the size of a fist, punched through the rock in a feat of strength far out of reach of one such as yourself.

Library
You arrive in a long room full of thousands and thousands of bookshelves, full to the brim with dust-covered tomes. An ancient library, with books on topics much to complex for you to understand. The shelves continue further south.

Behind you to the west, you see a rocky door in the wall.

To the east you see a thick metal door, its industrial design a strange contrast to the otherwise ancient design you've encountered in this world so far. Extruded from the door is a box labeled "KEY", apparently held closed by a 2-digit combination lock, which is a little odd for state-of-the-art security.

Library (Shelf #1)
This section of the library is much the same as all the rest: shelves of books to either side, untouched books lying on their shelves.

Lying on the shelf to your left, a dustless green tome lies on its side. Gold lettering on its spine reads "The Dialogues of Plato." Lower down, its call number is printed: 184.2.

Standing on the right shelf, a tome with a suspicious amount of dust rests on the right shelf. Silver lettering on its spine reads "The Great Transformation," and below that its call number is written "200.9."

Cobble Wall
You push through the door, and find yourself in a tiny room that ends abruptly to your left in an ancient cobblestone wall. The wall stretches up high above, ending just before the ceiling. Rocks here and there seem to have fallen out of the wall over the ages it has stood in place, creating holes of varying sizes in the walls (though as I believe I've made clear, it's not actually ancient because it's fake so the holes have been there since I created it).

To the north you can see the door you came through earlier.

In the center of the wall to the east, you can see a hole as average as yourself. It's so normal it's dissapointing.

To the southeast, you can see a miniscule hole, barely larger than your average United State dime, a ten-cent coin, one tenth of a United States dollar, labeled formally as "one dime". The denomination was first authorized by the Coinage Act of 1792. The dime is the smallest in diameter and is the thinnest of all U.S. coins currently minted for circulation, being 0.705 inches (17.91 millimeters) in diameter and 0.053 in (1.35 mm) in thickness. The hole looks like that.

In the northeast of the wall, you see a hole roughly the size of a fist, punched through the rock in a feat of strength far out of reach of one such as yourself.

Mirror Maze
You slide the bottom of the tunnel, and immediately are confronted by... octopi. Hundreds of octopi in every direction. You leap to get out of the way and let out a high-pitched shriek.

The octopi ripple as a laugh shakes the room.

You look closer at the octopi and see... mirrors. Boaz turned you into an octopus, and brought you to a mirror maze. Everywhere you look, octopi follow your gaze - eight tentacles sliding over the ground as you move. To the north you see a hallway continuing into the next room.

On the wall is a giant sign that says "PUZZLE INOPERABLE."

To the west you see a thick metal door.

Great Room
A grand room built from giant blocks of a sand-colored stone, stacked up to a ceiling high above where a massive compass lays embedded in the rock.

Back to the west you see a hallway, hewn out of the stone, leading to another room.

Before you to the east, taking up almost the entire wall, is a great metal door painted a deep blue and patterned with yellow and white veins that run throughout. At the base of the door are eight large keyholes.

Maze
You land in the next room just beyond the exit of the hallway, and the ground rumbles as it collapses behind you. You find yourself in what seems to be an ancient cobblestone maze. Rocks here and there seem to have fallen out of the wall over the ages it has stood in place, creating fist-sized holes in the walls. The path extends out to the east and west to either side. To the east you see a hallway continuing into the next room.

On the wall is a giant sign that says "PUZZLE INOPERABLE."

To the south, almost obscured behind a large gray couch, you see a closed door.

Cobble Wall
You push through the door, and find yourself in a tiny room. To your left a cobblestone wall stretches up high above, ending just before the ceiling. Rocks here and there seem to have fallen out of the wall over the ages it has stood in place, creating holes of varying sizes throughout the surface.

To the north you can see the door you came through earlier.

In the center of the wall to the east, you can see a hole as average as yourself. It's so normal it's disappointing.

To the southeast, you can see a miniscule hole, barely larger than your average United State dime, a ten-cent coin, one tenth of a United States dollar, labeled formally as "one dime". The denomination was first authorized by the Coinage Act of 1792. The dime is the smallest in diameter and is the thinnest of all U.S. coins currently minted for circulation, being 0.705 inches (17.91 millimeters) in diameter and 0.053 in (1.35 mm) in thickness. The hole is that size.

To the northeast, you see a hole roughly the size of a fist, punched through the rock in a feat of strength, possibly in frustration, possibly with this game.

Library
You arrive in a long room full of thousands and thousands of bookshelves, filled to the brim with dust-covered tomes. An ancient library, with books on topics much too complex for you to understand. The shelves continue further south.

Behind you to the west, you see a rocky door in the wall.

To the east you see a thick metal door, its industrial design a strange contrast to the otherwise ancient architecture you've encountered in this world so far.

Extruded from the door is a safe labeled "KEY", held closed by a 5-digit combination lock. There's a decimal point between the third and fourth digit of the number, which is odd for a combination lock.

Aquarium
You push through the door, and find yourself in a drastically different room with plain concrete walls and a black floor flecked with gray spots. The ceiling looks basically the same as the walls from where you're standing, but between you and me, it's a "living roof" - a roof with a grass on top.

To the north, a door that almost looks like a miniature of the grand door from the Great Room - metal blue panels with white-and-yellow veins, square but capped by a glass half-circle on the top - is embedded in the rock.

To the west you see a thick metal door.

In the center of the room, taking up the majority of the space in the room is a giant fish tank. The first half meter of the tank is black glass, presumably hiding the inner workings of the tank. Above the base, the glass tank walls extend up for two meters. There does not appear to be a lid, but a sign next to the tank says in red, "NO MOLLUSCS IN THE TANK." Half submerged in the sand at the bottom of the fish tank, a small metal object glints and sparkles in the light.

You reach above the glass lip with a tentacle and drop the fish into the water. It gives you a little wink and dives to the bottom of the tank, dissappearing into the reef. A few seconds later, a pair of keys fly out of the water and hit you square between the eyes.

Great Room
A grand room built from giant blocks of a sand-colored stone, stacked up to a ceiling high above where a massive compass lays embedded in the rock.

To the south, a small blue door is embedded in the rock.

Behind you to the west you see a hallway, hewn out of the stone, leading  to another room.

Before you to the east, taking up almost the entire wall, is a great metal door painted a deep blue and patterned with yellow and white veins that run throughout. At the base of the door are four keyholes and four doorknobs.

You pass through the stone hallway, and step out in to the most cluttered room you've ever seen. You spin around, and bump into a tall stack of chairs like a moron.

You find yourself in a room, half the size of the previous room, filled to the brim with chairs, folded tables, closed crates, and smaller tidbits scattered about.

Behind you to the east you see a hallway, hewn out of the stone, leading  to another room.

To the south, almost obscured behind a large gray couch, you see a door.

To your right you see a dented bucket overflowing with junk. Or maybe it's important items for progressing in the game.

The couch, lying to your left in front of the door, sags with (fake) age, and it's got tears in the tattered fabric in some places.

Cobble Wall
You push through the door, and find yourself in a tiny room.

To the north you can see the door you came through earlier.

In the center of the wall to the east, you can see a hole as average as yourself. It's so normal it's disappointing.

To the southeast, you can see a miniscule hole, barely larger than your average United State dime, a ten-cent coin, one tenth of a United States dollar, labeled formally as "one dime". The denomination was first authorized by the Coinage Act of 1792. The dime is the smallest in diameter and is the thinnest of all U.S. coins currently minted for circulation, being 0.705 inches (17.91 millimeters) in diameter and 0.053 in (1.35 mm) in thickness. The hole is that size.

To the northeast, you see a hole roughly the size of a fist, punched through the rock in a feat of strength, possibly in frustration, possibly with this game.

To your left a cobblestone wall stretches up high above, ending just before the ceiling. Rocks here and there seem to have fallen out of the wall over the ages it has stood in place, creating holes of varying sizes throughout the surface.

Cluttered Room
You pass through the stone hallway, and step out in to the most cluttered room you've ever seen. You spin around, and bump into a tall stack of chairs. A snicker echoes from above, and you're reminded about how stupid this situation is.

You find yourself in a room, half the size of the previous room, filled to the brim with chairs, folded tables, closed crates, and smaller tidbits: rolled-up newspapers, stacks of loose paper, broken electronics, a Peloton, watches in a display case, a lamp, pots and pans, and other bits such items scattered about. To the south, almost obscured behind a large gray couch, you see door.

To your left you see a dented bucket overflowing with junk. Or maybe it's important items for progressing in the game.

The couch lying in front of the door sags with (fake) age, and it's got tears in the tattered fabric in some places.

Cobble Wall
You push through the door, and find yourself in a thin, wide room that ends abruptly in front you in an ancient cobblestone wall. The wall stretches up high above, ending just before the ceiling. Rocks here and there seem to have fallen out of the wall over the ages it has stood in place, creating holes of varying sizes in the walls (though as I believe I've made clear, it's not actually ancient because it's fake so the holes have been there since I created it).

To the north you can see the door you came through earlier.

You can also see fist-sized hole here.

Cave of Shame
You squeeze yourself through the hole with surprising ease, but due to your inability to do anything properly you cause the entrance to cave in behind you. You find yourself in a bare cave, no larger than a fist. Once again, you're puzzled on how you fit.

Cluttered Room
You pass through the stone hallway, and step out in to the most cluttered room you've ever seen. You spin around, and bump into a tall stack of chairs. A snicker echoes from above, and you're reminded about how stupid this situation is.

You find yourself in a room, half the size of the previous room, filled to the brim with chairs, folded tables, closed crates, and smaller tidbits: rolled-up newspapers, stacks of loose paper, broken electronics, a Peloton, watches in a display case, a lamp, pots and pans, and other bits such items scattered about. To the south, almost obscured behind two stacked couches, you see door.

Cluttered Room
You pass through the stone hallway, and step out in to the most cluttered room you've ever seen. You spin around, and bump into a tall stack of chairs like a moron.

You find yourself in a room, half the size of the previous room, filled to the brim with chairs, folded tables, closed crates, and smaller tidbits scattered about.

Behind you to the east you see a hallway, hewn out of the stone, leading  to another room.

To the south, almost obscured behind a large gray couch, you see a door.

To your right you see a dented bucket overflowing with junk. Or maybe it's important items for progressing in the game.

The couch, lying to your left in front of the door, sags with (fake) age, and it's got tears in the tattered fabric in some places.

You land in the next room just beyond the exit of the hallway, and the ground rumbles as it collapses behind you. You find yourself in what seems to be an ancient cobblestone maze.

As you adjust to the realization that you're now a cephalapod, you move into the next room. You find yourself in a clean, black-floored room with fish tanks on either side. From your position, you can see a key taped to the ceiling. To the north you see a hallway continuing into the next room.

Shaken up from the crash, you move into the next room and are greeting by the familiar drone of computer fans. In front of you, you can see three rows of computers.

To your right you see a dented bucket overflowing with junk. Or maybe it's important items for progressing in the game.

The couch, lying to your left in front of the door, sags with (fake) age, and it's got tears in the tattered fabric in some places.

Cluttered Room
You pass through the stone hallway, and step out in to the most cluttered room you've ever seen. You spin around, and bump into a tall stack of chairs like a moron.

You find yourself in a room, half the size of the previous room, filled to the brim with chairs, folded tables, closed crates, and smaller tidbits scattered about.

Behind you to the east you see a hallway, hewn out of the stone, leading  to another room.

To the south, almost obscured behind a large gray couch, you see a door.

To your right you see a dented bucket overflowing with junk. Or maybe it's important items for progressing in the game.

The couch, lying to your left in front of the door, sags with (fake) age, and it's got tears in the tattered fabric in some places.

Cobble Wall
You push through the door, and find yourself in a tiny room that ends abruptly to your left in an ancient cobblestone wall. The wall stretches up high above, ending just before the ceiling. Rocks here and there seem to have fallen out of the wall over the ages it has stood in place, creating holes of varying sizes in the walls (though as I believe I've made clear, it's not actually ancient because it's fake so the holes have been there since I created it).

To the north you can see the door you came through earlier.

In the center of the wall to the east, you can see a hole as average as yourself. It's so normal it's dissapointing.

To the southeast, you can see a miniscule hole, barely larger than your average United State dime, a ten-cent coin, one tenth of a United States dollar, labeled formally as "one dime". The denomination was first authorized by the Coinage Act of 1792. The dime is the smallest in diameter and is the thinnest of all U.S. coins currently minted for circulation, being 0.705 inches (17.91 millimeters) in diameter and 0.053 in (1.35 mm) in thickness. The hole looks like that.

In the northeast of the wall, you see a hole roughly the size of a fist, punched through the rock in a feat of strength far out of reach of one such as yourself.

Library
You arrive in a long room full of thousands and thousands of bookshelves, full to the brim with dust-covered tomes. An ancient library, with books on topics much to complex for you to understand. The shelves continue further south.

Behind you to the west, you see a rocky door in the wall.

To the east you see a thick metal door, its industrial design a strange contrast to the otherwise ancient design you've encountered in this world so far. Extruded from the door is a box labeled "KEY", apparently held closed by a 2-digit combination lock, which is a little odd for state-of-the-art security.

Lying on the shelf to your left, a dustless green tome lies on its side. Gold lettering on its spine reads "THE DIALOGUES OF PLATO." Lower down, its call number is printed: 184.2.

Standing on the right shelf, a tome with a suspicious amount of dust rests on the right shelf. Silver lettering on its spine reads "THE GREAT TRANSFORMATION," and below that its call number is written "200.9."

Cluttered Room
You pass through the stone hallway, and step out in to the most cluttered room you've ever seen. You spin around, and bump into a tall stack of chairs like a moron.

You find yourself in a room, half the size of the previous room, filled to the brim with chairs, folded tables, closed crates, and smaller tidbits scattered about.

Behind you to the east you see a hallway, hewn out of the stone, leading  to another room.

To the south, almost obscured behind a large gray couch, you see a door.

To your right you see a dented bucket overflowing with junk. Or maybe it's important items for progressing in the game.

The couch, lying to your left in front of the door, sags with (fake) age, and it's got tears in the tattered fabric in some places.

Cobble Wall
You push through the door, and find yourself in a tiny room that ends abruptly to your left in an ancient cobblestone wall. The wall stretches up high above, ending just before the ceiling. Rocks here and there seem to have fallen out of the wall over the ages it has stood in place, creating holes of varying sizes in the walls (though as I believe I've made clear, it's not actually ancient because it's fake so the holes have been there since I created it).

To the north you can see the door you came through earlier.

In the center of the wall to the east, you can see a hole as average as yourself. It's so normal it's dissapointing.

To the southeast, you can see a miniscule hole, barely larger than your average United State dime, a ten-cent coin, one tenth of a United States dollar, labeled formally as "one dime". The denomination was first authorized by the Coinage Act of 1792. The dime is the smallest in diameter and is the thinnest of all U.S. coins currently minted for circulation, being 0.705 inches (17.91 millimeters) in diameter and 0.053 in (1.35 mm) in thickness. The hole looks like that.

In the northeast of the wall, you see a hole roughly the size of a fist, punched through the rock in a feat of strength far out of reach of one such as yourself.

Library
You arrive in a long room full of thousands and thousands of bookshelves, full to the brim with dust-covered tomes. An ancient library, with books on topics much to complex for you to understand. The shelves continue further south.

Behind you to the west, you see a rocky door in the wall.

To the east you see a thick metal door, its industrial design a strange contrast to the otherwise ancient design you've encountered in this world so far. Extruded from the door is a box labeled "KEY", apparently held closed by a 2-digit combination lock, which is a little odd for state-of-the-art security.

Library (Shelf #1)
This section of the library is much the same as all the rest: shelves of books to either side, untouched books lying on their shelves. The main room is back to the north, and the shelves continue south.

Lying on the shelf to your left, a dustless green tome lies on its side. Gold lettering on its spine reads "The Dialogues of Plato." Lower down, its call number is printed: 184.2.

Standing on the right shelf, a tome with a suspicious amount of dust rests on the right shelf. Silver lettering on its spine reads "The Great Transformation," and below that its call number is written "200.9."

This section of the library is much the same as all the rest: shelves of books to either side, untouched books lying on their shelves. The library continues both north and south.

Directly in front of you, a white novel rests on the ground. Black type on its cover reads "Outliers." On its spine a call number is printed: 302.6.

Peeking over the edge of the right shelf, a yellow book hangs above your head face-down. From where you stand, you can see bold black-and-blue lettering, "Because Internet." On its spine, a call number reads "402.231."

This section of the library is much the same as all the rest: shelves of books to either side, untouched books lying on their shelves. A small glyph is carved into the wood of a shelf here that looks faintly like an "x," but you can't quite recognize what it is. The library continues both north and south.

On one of the shelves here, a dustless book rests facing you. On its cover, a detailed picture of a pie is partly obscured by the text, "Eight Pies," emblazoned in white. On its spine a call number is printed: 594.56.

Right next to the recipe book, a black book seems to have disturbed the dust. On its cover, yellow ASCII marks the book as "Cult of the Dead Cow." On its spine, a call number reads "605.8."

A white and red book lies flat on top of the other books here. Written in black about a great red pirate flag are the words, "Enemy of All Mankind." On its spine, a call number reads "910.45."
