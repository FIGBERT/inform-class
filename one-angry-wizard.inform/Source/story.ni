	If the second noun is the brass key:
		Say "You put the brass key in the brass keyhole. You turn it to the right, but it doesn't budge. You don't appear to be able to turn this key by itself.";
		Try silently inserting the brass key into the brass keyhole;
		Stop the action;
	If the second noun is the tentacles and the silver key is in the silver keyhole and the gold key is in the gold keyhole and the copper key is in the copper keyhole and the brass key is in the brass keyhole:
		Try silently winning the great metal door;
	Otherwise:
		Say "What?";
		Stop the action.

Instead of turning a doorknob, say "You turn [the noun], and nothing happens. You don't appear to be able to turn this doorknob by itself.".

Instead of examining the hidden utilities:
	Say "[description of the hidden utilities][line break]".

Every turn:
	Now the tentacles are in the hidden utilities.
